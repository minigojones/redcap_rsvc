    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that export data is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.5.21.100.100 Limit identified data export
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "B.5.21.100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_5.21.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_USER_RIGHTS

        And I enter "Test_User1" into the field with the placeholder text of "Assign new user to role"
        And I click on the button labeled "Assign to role"
        And I select "4_NoAccess_Noexport" on the dropdown field labeled "Select Role" on the role selector dropdown
        And I click on the button labeled exactly "Assign" on the role selector dropdown
