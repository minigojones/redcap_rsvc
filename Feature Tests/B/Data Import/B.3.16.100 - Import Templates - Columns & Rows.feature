    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data import is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.3.16.100.100 data import template
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "B.3.16.100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_3.16.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        When I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box to request a change in project status
        Then I should see "Project status: Production"

        #FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION Data Import Template (with records in rows)
        When I click on the link labeled "Data Import Tool"

        ##VERIFY
        When I open the csv file labeled "B316100100_ImportTemplate_[timestamp]"
        Then I should see "record_id" in the column labeled "A"
        And I should see "name" in the column labeled "B"
        #M: close csv file

        #FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT
